vr_C_sample is a collection of code from VideoRay that I used to develop the robot_api.py file.  

Look at vr_C_sample/rov_sample.c on how to use the device.
Look at vr_C_sample/inc/protocol_pro4.h for the communication protocol.
Look at vr_C_sample/inc/pro4_specific_response.h to get a feel for response packets.
